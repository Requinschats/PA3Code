Starvation is handled mostly in isAPhilosphereStarving() monitor private method. 
Every time a philosopher tries to pickup his two sticks, the previous method is called.

In pickUp() method, if a philosopher is starving, all other philosopher threads are put on wait() in a while loop and starving threads gets indirectly the first priority to pick its two sticks
